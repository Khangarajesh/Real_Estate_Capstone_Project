for accurate real estate price prediction, in-depth market analysis, and personalized property recommendations. 
The system will utilize machine learning regression models to forecast property prices, conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
to uncover meaningful insights about market trends and customer preferences, and implement a recommendation engine powered by collaborative filtering
 algorithms. The primary goal is to empower homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals with data-driven insights,
